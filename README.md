This is my own photo gallery.

Hope you guys could feel peace || fun || sth. other from my pictures and enjoy them:).

The camera is Nikon Z6 mark II, lenses include: Nikkor Z 24-70mm F4S, Nikkor Z 50mm F1.8S, Nikkor Z 24-120mm F4S.

This repository also contains a image processing script written in Python, it can enlarge your pictures and indicate your picture info, including shutter speed, aperture size, ISO value and camera model and lens model.

You can cange the image of camera icon if you use those cameras like Cannon, Sony, etc., it's easy to change, I'll make it more flexible and easier to sue later.
